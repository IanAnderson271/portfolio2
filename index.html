        <h2>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>My name is Ian Anderson. I am a senior at Fern Creek High School, and have been in the computer science program for 4 years. Of those 4 years, i only spent in school for 2, due to the covid pandemic. Throughout those 2 years that we were stuck in our homes, I struggled to find my way back to school, and was often distracted during my Sophomore and Junior year. My struggle comes with the ability to overcome, and although I may not be the best at my job, I can still get the job done. </p>
        <h3>Why CSP?</h3>
        <p>Ever since I was a kid, I've had a liking to video games. Whether it was some random kid game my parents got me at some book store, or if it was just watching videos, I loved the idea of video games. So, that love for video games made me want to get my feet wet and get into computer science. </p>
        <h3>What do I enjoy?</h3>
        <p>Growing up in Louisville, I have developed a love hate relationship with sports. Now since there isn't any professional sports teams in Louisville, I pretty much had 2 options. I could either be a Louisville fan, or a Kentucky fan. Since my family has mainly been a Louisville fan ever since we've lived in Kentucky, thats the way I went. In my early years, Louisville fans were pretty spoiled. We had a good football and basketball team for a few years, and then some drama came. After a couple rough seasons, some stars rose, and I decided to ride along with them. The 2 players that I follow are Lamar Jackson and Donovan Mitchell. Through following those players, I strated to love football and basketball even more, and that is where I developed my Interest in sports. </p>
        <h3>Me ranting about football</h3>
        <p> I wasn't always in love with the idea of going with tech as my career. I had the basic stages of wanting to be multiple things. Originally, I wanted to be a basketball player, and since im like 5'8, I don't think that would of gone well. So then, I wanted to become a youtuber. Through multiple madden mobile videos, some roblox videos, and mainly minecraft videos, let's just say that youtube wasn't for me. Now that I'm older, and I know more about those type of things, I still think I could have a youtube channel or twitch channel as a second job that would increase my income. So now, I'm mixed with what I want to do with my life. My main thoughts have been with combining those 2 "career" choices. I've always loved to talk about sports, mainly football. So what would be better than to want to become a proffesional at it? Although it wouldn't really work out the way I would want it to (because I'm an introvert and suck at talking), I would love to become a commentator. The thought of making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year just by talking about something you really love talking about, and being able to go to big games sounds really good to me. An average NFL commentator makes upward of $1 Million a season. That's not even for a full year of football, that's like 6 months. Although It would be nice to be able to do that, the chances of being able to commentate proffesional football is pretty much the same chance that you have to actaully get on a team.  </p>
